possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life, all based around the number 23. as the story unfolds in real life and fiction, sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.<br /><br />the number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. the screenplay was probably the worst part about it. it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. the second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.<br /><br />joel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. he has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. he switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. the actual book in the film that's titled \\\"the number 23\\\" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. when carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. at this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished.<br /><br />the acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. his narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. virginia madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston. overall, the number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. rating 3/10\",\n          \"i cannot believe i enjoyed this as much as i did. the anthology stories were better than par, but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me. alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself \\\"where i have i seen them before?\\\" forget the running time listed on new line's tape, this ain't no 103 minutes, according to my vcr timer and imdb. space maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8.\",\n          \"caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason, while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield. ty webb is funny, being the only character from the original. most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (henry wilcoxon for example) except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt, being played by randy quaid. every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office (i don't go in for law suits or motions. i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale,maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it. and then i'm comin' upstairs junior, and i'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a**! do we have an understanding?). offsetting his small role however, is dan acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for bill murray. his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. overall caddyshack ii is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
